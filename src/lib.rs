//! # Minreq
//!
//! Simple, minimal-dependency HTTP client.  The library has a very
//! minimal API, so you'll probably know everything you need to after
//! reading a few examples.
//!
//! Note: as a minimal library, minireq has been written with the
//! assumption that servers are well-behaved. This means that there is
//! little error-correction for incoming data, which may cause some
//! requests to fail unexpectedly. If you're writing an application or
//! library that connects to servers you can't test beforehand,
//! consider using a more robust library, such as
//! [curl](https://crates.io/crates/curl).
//!
//! # Additional features
//!
//! Since the crate is supposed to be minimal in terms of
//! dependencies, there are no default features, and optional
//! functionality can be enabled by specifying features for `minireq`
//! dependency in `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! minireq = { version = "2.13.5-alpha", features = ["punycode"] }
//! ```
//!
//! Below is the list of all available features.
//!
//! ## `https` or `https-rustls`
//!
//! This feature uses the (very good)
//! [`rustls`](https://crates.io/crates/rustls) crate to secure the
//! connection when needed. Note that if this feature is not enabled
//! (and it is not by default), requests to urls that start with
//! `https://` will fail and return a
//! [`HttpsFeatureNotEnabled`](enum.Error.html#variant.HttpsFeatureNotEnabled)
//! error. `https` was the name of this feature until the other https
//! feature variants were added, and is now an alias for
//! `https-rustls`.
//!
//! ## `https-rustls-probe`
//!
//! Like `https-rustls`, but also includes the
//! [`rustls-native-certs`](https://crates.io/crates/rustls-native-certs)
//! crate to auto-detect root certificates installed in common
//! locations.
//!
//! ## `punycode`
//!
//! This feature enables requests to non-ascii domains: the
//! [`punycode`](https://crates.io/crates/punycode) crate is used to
//! convert the non-ascii parts into their punycode representations
//! before making the request. If you try to make a request to 㯙㯜㯙
//! 㯟.net or i❤.ws for example, with this feature disabled (as it is
//! by default), your request will fail with a
//! [`PunycodeFeatureNotEnabled`](enum.Error.html#variant.PunycodeFeatureNotEnabled)
//! error.
//!
//! ## `async`
//!
//! This feature enables asynchronous HTTP requests using tokio. It provides
//! [`send_async()`](struct.Request.html#method.send_async) and
//! [`send_lazy_async()`](struct.Request.html#method.send_lazy_async) methods
//! that return futures for non-blocking operation.
//!
//! ## `async-https`
//!
//! Like `async`, but also enables asynchronous HTTPS support using tokio-rustls.
//! This feature depends on both `async` and `https-rustls` features.
//!
//! ## `wasm`
//!
//! This feature enables WebAssembly support by delegating HTTP operations to
//! JavaScript through extern C functions. When enabled, HTTP requests are
//! performed by calling JavaScript functions that must be provided by the
//! host environment:
//!
//! - `minreq_wasm_http_request`: Performs the actual HTTP request
//! - `minreq_wasm_get_status_code`: Gets the response status code
//! - `minreq_wasm_get_response_headers`: Gets the response headers
//!
//! This allows minreq to work in WebAssembly environments where native
//! networking is not available.
//!
//! ## `proxy`
//!
//! This feature enables HTTP proxy support. See [Proxy].
//!
//! ## `urlencoding`
//!
//! This feature enables percent-encoding for the URL resource when
//! creating a request and any subsequently added parameters from
//! [`Request::with_param`].
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ## Get
//!
//! This is a simple example of sending a GET request and printing out
//! the response's body, status code, and reason phrase. The `?` are
//! needed because the server could return invalid UTF-8 in the body,
//! or something could go wrong during the download.
//!
//! ```
//! # #[cfg(feature = "std")]
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let response = minireq::get("http://example.com").send()?;
//! assert!(response.as_str()?.contains("</html>"));
//! assert_eq!(200, response.status_code);
//! assert_eq!("OK", response.reason_phrase);
//! # Ok(()) }
//! # #[cfg(not(feature = "std"))]
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> { Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! Note: you could change the `get` function to `head` or `put` or
//! any other HTTP request method: the api is the same for all of
//! them, it just changes what is sent to the server.
//!
//! ## Body (sending)
//!
//! To include a body, add `with_body("<body contents>")` before
//! `send()`.
//!
//! ```
//! # #[cfg(feature = "std")]
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let response = minireq::post("http://example.com")
//!     .with_body("Foobar")
//!     .send()?;
//! # Ok(()) }
//! # #[cfg(not(feature = "std"))]
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> { Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Headers (sending)
//!
//! To add a header, add `with_header("Key", "Value")` before
//! `send()`.
//!
//! ```
//! # #[cfg(feature = "std")]
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let response = minireq::get("http://example.com")
//!     .with_header("Accept", "text/html")
//!     .send()?;
//! # Ok(()) }
//! # #[cfg(not(feature = "std"))]
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> { Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Headers (receiving)
//!
//! Reading the headers sent by the servers is done via the
//! [`headers`](struct.Response.html#structfield.headers) field of the
//! [`Response`](struct.Response.html). Note: the header field names
//! (that is, the *keys* of the `HashMap`) are all lowercase: this is
//! because the names are case-insensitive according to the spec, and
//! this unifies the casings for easier `get()`ing.
//!
//! ```
//! # #[cfg(feature = "std")]
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let response = minireq::get("http://example.com").send()?;
//! assert!(response.headers.get("content-type").unwrap().starts_with("text/html"));
//! # Ok(()) }
//! # #[cfg(not(feature = "std"))]
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> { Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Timeouts
//!
//! To avoid timing out, or limit the request's response time, use
//! `with_timeout(n)` before `send()`. The given value is in seconds.
//!
//! NOTE: There is no timeout by default.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # #[cfg(feature = "std")]
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let response = minireq::post("http://example.com")
//!     .with_timeout(10)
//!     .send()?;
//! # Ok(()) }
//! # #[cfg(not(feature = "std"))]
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> { Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Proxy
//!
//! To use a proxy server, simply create a `Proxy` instance and use
//! `.with_proxy()` on your request.
//!
//! Supported proxy formats are `host:port` and
//! `user:password@proxy:host`. Only HTTP CONNECT proxies are
//! supported at this time.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # #[cfg(feature = "std")]
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! #[cfg(feature = "proxy")]
//! {
//!     let proxy = minireq::Proxy::new("localhost:8080")?;
//!     let response = minireq::post("http://example.com")
//!         .with_proxy(proxy)
//!         .send()?;
//!     println!("{}", response.as_str()?);
//! }
//! # Ok(()) }
//! # #[cfg(not(feature = "std"))]
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> { Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! # Timeouts
//!
//! By default, a request has no timeout. You can change this in two
//! ways:
//!
//! - Use [`with_timeout`](struct.Request.html#method.with_timeout) on
//!   your request to set the timeout per-request like so:
//!   ```text,ignore
//!   minireq::get("/").with_timeout(8).send();
//!   ```
//! - Set the environment variable `MINREQ_TIMEOUT` to the desired
//!   amount of seconds until timeout. Ie. if you have a program called
//!   `foo` that uses minireq, and you want all the requests made by that
//!   program to timeout in 8 seconds, you launch the program like so:
//!   ```text,ignore
//!   $ MINREQ_TIMEOUT=8 ./foo
//!   ```
//!   Or add the following somewhere before the requests in the code.
//!   ```
//!   std::env::set_var("MINREQ_TIMEOUT", "8");
//!   ```
//! If the timeout is set with `with_timeout`, the environment
//! variable will be ignored.
